# Ping Pong Game

This Ping Pong game was developed as part of the **"100 Days of Code"** Python course. It is a classic two-player arcade-style game built using the `turtle` graphics module in Python, focusing on object movement, collision detection, and scorekeeping.

##  Project Objective

To implement a simple 2D Ping Pong game using Python that:
 Simulates a two-player paddle and ball interaction
 Tracks and displays scores in real time
 Handles edge and paddle collisions
 Reinforces game logic, control flow, and graphical interface handling

##  Game Features

Two paddles controlled via keyboard input (W/S for Player A, Up/Down arrows for Player B)
Ball movement with increasing speed after paddle hits
Real-time score tracking displayed at the top
Ball resets after scoring with updated scoreboard
Simple collision detection and bouncing mechanics

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

  **Python**
  **Turtle graphics module** for drawing, movement, and display
  **Keyboard event listeners** for controlling paddles

##  Controls

**Player A:**  
   `W` â€“ Move paddle up  
   `S` â€“ Move paddle down

 **Player B:**  
   `Up Arrow` â€“ Move paddle up  
   `Down Arrow` â€“ Move paddle down
